# GreenPak Plantation Application

## Abstract

This project demonstrates the making of a greener environment through the plantation of trees. Users will register themselves in the database, and after planting a tree in their locale, they will provide us with the exact coordinates and description about the plant. Every user will be rewarded with points for plantation. Their points will lead to different prizes for instance, being invited to formal dinners with the mayor of the city, governor, and chief minister etc. Each and every plantation will be verified by one of our team members to avoid fake credit points.

## Dedication

We dedicate our work firstly to our parents and then to our respected teacher, Dr. Musadaq Mansoor, who has played a pivotal role in our studies and has guided us at every step with his precious ideas. No doubt this dedication is insufficient and we can never repay him for the role which he has played in our studies but we are sure that his work will prove itself as a valuable asset in our life.
