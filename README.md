# GreenPak Plantation Application

## Abstract

This project demonstrates the making of a greener environment through the plantation of trees. Users will register themselves in the database, and after planting a tree in their locale, they will provide us with the exact coordinates and description about the plant. Every user will be rewarded with points for plantation. Their points will lead to different prizes for instance, being invited to formal dinners with the mayor of the city, governor, and chief minister etc. Each and every plantation will be verified by one of our team members to avoid fake credit points.

## Dedication

We dedicate our work firstly to our parents and then to our respected teacher, Dr. Musadaq Mansoor, who has played a pivotal role in our studies and has guided us at every step with his precious ideas. No doubt this dedication is insufficient and we can never repay him for the role which he has played in our studies but we are sure that his work will prove itself as a valuable asset in our life.


## Acknowledgements

I would like to express our sincerest gratitude towards our project supervisor, Mr. Musadaq Mansoor for making us skillful enough for working on such a high-level project such as the application under development and considering us capable enough of giving us such an opportunity. It would have never been possible had it not been for his constant guidance and support.
The completion of the project was fully dependent on the structuration of the project report supervisor. Achieving this milestone could not have been possible without the invaluable and perpetual guidance, support, comments and suggestions provided by our course supervisor, Mr. Basit, throughout the course of the project.
Last but not the least, I would like to thank my team mates. They deserve kudos for the way in which they organized the project at such short notice. Heartfelt thanks to all.

## Preface

This report has been prepared as part of our semester project. This report is prepared with the view to include all the details regarding the project that we carried out. This project of Green Pak was carried out on the instruction of Dr. Musadaq Mansoor as our semester project for the subject of Mobile Computing.
The main purpose behind this project is to promote the concept of plantation in citizens and create awareness about the benefits of vegetation and plantations. Our project is inspired from the Clean Green Pakistan (CGP), which is a flagship five-year campaign of the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Imran Khan.

## Summary

Global warming and environmental degradation issues related to deforestation were the key factors that lead us to the idea of GreenPak. We aimed at helping our country and environment by pursuing this project that will not only help the Ten Billion Trees Tsunami Program (TBTTP) in achieving their goal, but also motivate the youth of our country to participate in such initiatives. We carried out this project so everyone will get a chance to contribute to the betterment of our environment. Anyone can register and start planting trees to get points alongside contributing the greater cause of protecting our environment.

## Introduction

Green Pak is a project that is developed for the plantation of trees in order to make the environment greener. Pakistan currently suffers from a life-threatening heat wave, climate change that is one of the many calamities caused due to the non-existence of trees. The fact that trees are being cut makes Pakistan suffer from critical air pollution. Another serious predicament due to non-existence of trees is the factual loss of all-natural resources beyond recovery. All these reasons have led our team to come up with a software that is a solution on a smaller scale to somehow revive the greenery that Pakistan needs to get rid of all these problems.
In Green Pak, Users will be able to register themselves firstly. After planting a tree in their locale, they will provide us with the exact coordinates and description about the tree that is planted. Every user will be rewarded with points for plantation. Every point a user earns will add up ultimately resulting in different prizes. For instance, being invited to formal dinners with Mayor of the city, the Governor, and the Chief Minister etc. Each and every plantation will be verified by one of our team members to avoid fake credit points. Green Pak is a small step that looks forward to play a vital role in making the picture of a clean and green Pakistan become reality.

## About Our App

Our project consists of different functionalities that would help users to register. Users will be able to register themselves through their Email/Phone number and CNIC number. They will also be able to add their profile picture, age, location and their introduction. Users also will be provided with the functionality of ‘Forgot Password’ in order to recover their passwords. The main goal of our app is to motivate people to plant as many trees as they can throughout the nation. Users would be able to plant a single tree and upload its log. They will be given the option of arranging a plantation drive where people can meet and plant in large amounts. Users would be able to upload a snapshot of the ground before the plantation and one right after the plantation in order to verify the plantation and make sure the points given to them are fair. Users will be also provided with a platform where they will be able to donate seeds, plants and money. After every milestone, users will be awarded with achievements that can be in the form of dinners, ceremonies with high-ranked government officials or other swags. Different events will also be arranged throughout the year for the users to meet under one roof along with a plantation drive. This will motivate users to plant as much as they can, which will result in the desired Green Environment.Our mobile app will also have the functionality for users to report problems. They also will be able to upload a picture related to the problem.


## Conclusion

Pakistan’s deforestation rates the world’s highest as mentioned in DAWN news, on the 13th of July, 2021. It is obvious from this that such a tendency will lead to increase in the spread of many life- threatening diseases. Cutting down trees and disturbing the natural order of mother nature has become a grave threat in Pakistan today. In the 2010 research report by National Environment Information System (NEIMS), it was feared that the natural resources were decreasing at such an alarming speed that all forest area would be consumed within the next five years. In 2021, we are on the brink of deforestation and in doing so, welcoming the extinction of all the natural resources that are mandatory for the growth of Pakistan. Due to the loss of trees, many problems like climate change, desertification, soil erosion, fewer crops and increased air pollution take flight. Apart from these problems, trees are a natural shelter from protection against extreme heat waves, the type of which cities like Peshawar, Islamabad and Rawalpindi suffer from today.

Project “GreenPak” aims towards the restoration and plantation of the greenery that Pakistan lacks today, but on a minor scale. GreenPak is a project that encircles every human being to do his/her part in the plantation of trees for the betterment of their homeland. This sole purpose of this project is to take small steps towards the prevention of total deforestation, a calamity that lingers over Pakistan like a hammer that’s about to fall. Project GreenPak provides an opportunity to every individual to play their part in planting trees in their own region, and collectively, by plantation of trees in every region of Pakistan, revive the greenery of Pakistan to an extent that complete deforestation is prevented. This project will not only be beneficial for Pakistan, but the individuals that take over the initiative to plant trees in their region will be rewarded on the basis of the count of trees that they plant. This way, when every individual takes part in plantation of trees in their region, Pakistan will not run out of natural resources, the climate change won’t be so drastic, the heat waves won’t be minacious and the pollution will be minimal. GreenPak is as simple as the name suggests, in order to revive the greenery, all an individual need to do is plant a tree, send the coordinates on the application, gain points and get rewards.
