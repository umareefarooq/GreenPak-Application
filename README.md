# GreenPak Plantation Application

## Abstract

This project demonstrates the making of a greener environment through the plantation of trees. Users will register themselves in the database, and after planting a tree in their locale, they will provide us with the exact coordinates and description about the plant. Every user will be rewarded with points for plantation. Their points will lead to different prizes for instance, being invited to formal dinners with the mayor of the city, governor, and chief minister etc. Each and every plantation will be verified by one of our team members to avoid fake credit points.

## Dedication

We dedicate our work firstly to our parents and then to our respected teacher, Dr. Musadaq Mansoor, who has played a pivotal role in our studies and has guided us at every step with his precious ideas. No doubt this dedication is insufficient and we can never repay him for the role which he has played in our studies but we are sure that his work will prove itself as a valuable asset in our life.


## Acknowledgements

I would like to express our sincerest gratitude towards our project supervisor, Mr. Musadaq Mansoor for making us skillful enough for working on such a high-level project such as the application under development and considering us capable enough of giving us such an opportunity. It would have never been possible had it not been for his constant guidance and support.
The completion of the project was fully dependent on the structuration of the project report supervisor. Achieving this milestone could not have been possible without the invaluable and perpetual guidance, support, comments and suggestions provided by our course supervisor, Mr. Basit, throughout the course of the project.
Last but not the least, I would like to thank my team mates. They deserve kudos for the way in which they organized the project at such short notice. Heartfelt thanks to all.

## Preface

This report has been prepared as part of our semester project. This report is prepared with the view to include all the details regarding the project that we carried out. This project of Green Pak was carried out on the instruction of Dr. Musadaq Mansoor as our semester project for the subject of Mobile Computing.
The main purpose behind this project is to promote the concept of plantation in citizens and create awareness about the benefits of vegetation and plantations. Our project is inspired from the Clean Green Pakistan (CGP), which is a flagship five-year campaign of the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Imran Khan.

## Summary

Global warming and environmental degradation issues related to deforestation were the key factors that lead us to the idea of GreenPak. We aimed at helping our country and environment by pursuing this project that will not only help the Ten Billion Trees Tsunami Program (TBTTP) in achieving their goal, but also motivate the youth of our country to participate in such initiatives. We carried out this project so everyone will get a chance to contribute to the betterment of our environment. Anyone can register and start planting trees to get points alongside contributing the greater cause of protecting our environment.

## Introduction

Green Pak is a project that is developed for the plantation of trees in order to make the environment greener. Pakistan currently suffers from a life-threatening heat wave, climate change that is one of the many calamities caused due to the non-existence of trees. The fact that trees are being cut makes Pakistan suffer from critical air pollution. Another serious predicament due to non-existence of trees is the factual loss of all-natural resources beyond recovery. All these reasons have led our team to come up with a software that is a solution on a smaller scale to somehow revive the greenery that Pakistan needs to get rid of all these problems.
In Green Pak, Users will be able to register themselves firstly. After planting a tree in their locale, they will provide us with the exact coordinates and description about the tree that is planted. Every user will be rewarded with points for plantation. Every point a user earns will add up ultimately resulting in different prizes. For instance, being invited to formal dinners with Mayor of the city, the Governor, and the Chief Minister etc. Each and every plantation will be verified by one of our team members to avoid fake credit points.
Green Pak is a small step that looks forward to play a vital role in making the picture of a clean and green Pakistan become reality
